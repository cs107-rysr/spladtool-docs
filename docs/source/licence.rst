Licencing
======================

This project will be licensed using the traditional MIT license due to several factors.

- We will be using code from the NumPy library which the MIT license coincides with.
- As of now, we do not foresee having to deal with any patents or any other dependencies.
- Since this project won’t contain an abundance of novel code (and, therefore, could be duplicated quite easily), we don’t mind letting others use it as they please.
- Due to the small scale of the project, we are hoping to use a license which is similarly simple. The MIT license is the best match for our interests outlined above.
